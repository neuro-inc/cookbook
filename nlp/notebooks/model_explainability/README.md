# Model Explainability

This folder contains examples and best practices, written in Jupyter notebooks, for explaining and
interpreting models. Being able to explain and understand machine learning models not only helps
guiding further model improvements, but more importantly, it's critical for gaining users' trust in the
models and detecting biases caused by the training data.
